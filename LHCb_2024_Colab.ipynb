Background and signal are indistinguishable now as the detector cannot tell the difference and our cuts were unable to remove the events for physics reasons. We can do some statistical analysis, if we know the approximate shapes of our signal and our background. Just like a least-squares fitting we can run a fit routine to minimise the error between the fitted curve and our data. As an example, if we know our data has an exponential background and a gaussian signal:\n",
